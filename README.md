The provided code represents a simplified banking system, encapsulating the functionality within a Python class named Bankaccount:

Core Components:
1. Bankaccount Class:
This class is the heart of the banking system, containing all the methods necessary for performing banking operations.
2. Initialization Method (__init__):
It's automatically called when an instance of the Bankaccount class is created.
Welcomes the user and prompts them to choose between logging in (if they are an existing user) or creating a new account.
Based on the input, it either proceeds with the login process or the account creation process. If an invalid option is entered, it recursively calls itself to prompt the user again, which could be risky due to the potential for a stack overflow with repeated invalid inputs.
3. User Authentication (Login):
For existing users, it checks the provided account number and password against stored details in the Account dictionary (imported from account_details.py). If the credentials match, it allows access to further banking operations.
4. Banking Operations:
Balance Inquiry: Shows the current balance in the user's account.
Withdrawal: Enables the user to withdraw a specified amount, provided it does not exceed their current balance.
Deposit: Allows the user to add a specified amount to their balance.
Change PIN: Offers the option to change the account's password (PIN).
Cancel Transaction: Exits the banking session, using sys.exit() to terminate the program.
5. New User Registration:
New users are prompted to enter their name and set a password. The system then generates a random account number and initializes the account with a zero balance. This information is added to the Account dictionary.
