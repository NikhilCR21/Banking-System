This code is a basic simulation of a banking system created in Python. It offers functionalities for both new and existing users,
allowing them to perform operations like logging in, checking their balance, withdrawing money, depositing money, changing their PIN, and exiting the system. 
The system interacts with users through text-based menus and prompts for input, making decisions based on the user's choices. Account details are stored in a dictionary and updated in a file,
ensuring persistence of data across sessions.This program showcases fundamental programming concepts such as classes, methods, conditionals, input handling, and file operations in Python.
